Children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) often struggle with focus, impulse control, and adapting to changing situations. **Steve vs Blobs** is a game I developed featuring Steve from Minecraft, inspired by research suggesting that color stimulation can improve attention and behavior in children with ADHD. The game uses colorful targets and quick decision-making to help players practice focus and self-control in a fun, engaging way.

**Story:** 

Steve is trapped in a 3D arena as colorful Blobs relentlessly close in on him. If a Blob touches Steve, his health drops. He must destroy the Blobs before they reach him. After clearing a wave, a new wave appears. Over time, both the number of Blobs and their speed increase.

**Gameplay:**
* Control Steve on a 3D plane using the WASD keys (W to move forward, S to move backward, A to turn left, D to turn right).
* Use the left mouse button to shoot the Blobs and the right mouse button to switch between third-person and first-person camera modes.
* Switch between red, green, and blue paintballs using the 1, 2, and 3 keys to match each Blob’s color.
* Hitting a Blob with the correct paintball color destroys it. Using the wrong color instead makes the Blob grow larger. The bigger the Blob, the more correct paintballs it takes to destroy it.
* Blobs appear in waves. Once all Blobs in a wave are destroyed, a new wave begins. As time passes, the Blobs become faster and appear in greater numbers.
* Two types of power-ups appear at random. Collecting the Cyan Cube grants a 5-second shield that prevents health loss when Blobs touch Steve. Collecting the Orange Sphere freezes all Blobs for 5 seconds.
* There are also two cheats. Press H to give Steve infinite health. Press L to activate Lava Attack, where Steve automatically shoots Blobs with the correct paintball color.
* Press P to pause the game, R to reset, and Esc or X to exit.
